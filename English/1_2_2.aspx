The holy <font class="imp_sentence_english"> mountain spread across 350 acres of landscape and more than 2000 feet above sea level, </font> accommodating the <font class="imp_sentence_english"> holy temple at height of 650 feet from the ground and standing upright like a majestic vision above a leading stairway of 1206 steps. </font> <br /> <br />
Although the mountain is popularly known as Tiruchengode Mountain, this holy hill has been called by many names all along in many different historical literary works. <br /> <br />
This holy mountain is called by many revered names like <font class="imp_sentence_english"> Semmalai, Merumalai, Sivamalai, Nagasalam, Panimalai, Bhramagiri, Vaayumalai, kongumalai, Nagagiri, Vandhimalai, Sithar malai, sonagiri, Thandhagiri, Uragaverpu, Sarpapagiri, Surapagiri, Thandhagiri, Theivathirumalai, Gothaimayilathagiri, Gyanagiri, Rathnagiri, Tharukasalam, Tharumalai, Magamerumalai, Kailai Malai, kongumalai </font> and the like.  <br /> <br />
This shrine is a special penance site for people born under the <font class="imp_sentence_english"> sathaya star. </font> The main deities for this star are “Sani and Rahu”. Praying to lord Arthanaareeswarar in this holy mountain is considered as atonement for devotees born of this particular star.     	 <br /> <br />
Along the Girivalam path of the Tiruchengode Mountains, as we look north of the Karatupalayam junction, one can witness the <font class="imp_sentence_english"> shape of a woman sleeping facing skyward. </font> In the same way along the Erode main road, southeast to the Kootapalli junction, one can <font class="imp_sentence_english"> witness the mountains in the shape of a sleeping male form. </font> <br /> <br />
To the north of the Sangagiri road the <font class="imp_sentence_english"> mountain takes the shape of a seated Nandhi. </font> West of Kumaramangalam, we can see the mountains as a <font class="imp_sentence_english"> squatting eagle with its wings spread open </font>. The general view of the mountains from the town seems like a <font class="imp_sentence_english"> cobra snake spreading its head and dancing. </font> A single  
mountain to have different facets like the male, female and many more unique forms, in the entire world is found in Tiruchengode. <br /> <br />
