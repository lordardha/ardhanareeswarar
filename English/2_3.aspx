We all know that Lord Narasimma moorthy, after tearing up the stomach of monster Iraniyan, drank his blood, and losing peace, became restless. Witnessing this, Lord Shiva took the form of a bird and went on to pick the Narasingam, carried him to the sky and shook him well. The stored blood spilled out, and Narasingam returned to the original look of Lord Perumal. <font class="imp_sentence_english">  Lord Thirumal, getting relieved from the sin came  to Kodi Maada Sengundroor, built a lake, took bath in the same and prayed to Lord Shiva and Parvathy. </font> In this   holy place, the temple got created with the Lord in it. This is how the historic epic of Tiruchengode is described.
