The cave situated below the Ucchi pillaiyaar temple next to the Pandava’s Bed is called the Biladwara Caves. These deep caves have no stairway leading towards it and it is commonly considered that it is  not an easy task to gain access to these caves.  Goddess Parvathy was said to have performed penance in these caves filled with holy water and waterfalls. These caves also are speculated to contain secret passages leading from Tiruchengode to Thiruvannamalai and it is believed that  many Rishi’s and sages  come  here to meditate and perform rituals. <br /> <br />
Due to lack of light, we were not able to go deep into the caves. This cave filled with natural beauty is a perfectly idyllic spot for meditating.
