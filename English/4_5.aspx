Aamai mandapam (tortoise hall) – this name was given to this hall, because the whole structure looks as if it is being held up by a tortoise. There is a vimanam (temple dome) on this hall. Though this dome looks like a concrete structure with story sculptures on it, it is actually a wooden sculpture hall. The interior of this wooden dome has many wheels. It is built in such a way that if flowers are spread over the roof of the dome, they fall on the God one by one through the hole. This has been working in the olden days.
