<font class="imp_sentence_english"> Tiruchengode, near Salem in Tamilnadu, India,  is perhaps the only place  where Shiva, the Divine Almighty, manifests himself as   Arthanaareeswarar, half male and half female. Through this website, we hope to fill the gaps in providing authentic, up-to-date and accurate information about this aspect of Lord Shiva. We humbly invoke his unending Grace and Blessings. </font>   The hallowed sanctity of this great shrine and the miracles it bestows on faithful devotees needs to be communicated to the entire world. We earnestly request the kind and heartfelt co-operation, guidance, support and blessings of all devotees in furthering this sacred and noble endeavour.
